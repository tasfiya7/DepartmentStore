The goal of this Java program is to manage a department store's inventory using Radio-frequency identification as a key in a doubly-linked list and also to write a simulator that allows merchandise to be manipulated within the store.  

Radio-frequency identification (RFID)--the emerging technology that involves small application-specific integrated chips affixed to individual products or pallets that emits a unique identification number over a radio frequency-- promises to revolutionize supply chains in a new era of efficiency, cost savings, and business intelligence. RFID has been around in some form, such as anti-theft immobilizers, for more than a decade. But large organizations, including department stores, are accelerating its adoption by mandating that their suppliers and members use the technology. RFID technology is an automatic way to collect product, place, time or transaction data quickly and easily without human intervention. It comprises a wireless reader (or interrogator), its associated antenna and small electronic transponders (Tags/ RFID Cards), and related infrastructure that carry the data.
